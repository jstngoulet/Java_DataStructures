Lab 2, writeup:
	1) a. O(n^2);
	    b.	O(n + 2) = O(n)
	    c. O(n^2)
	    d. O(n)
	3) See attached image
	4) for 20, each is around 1000 except for quadratic and exponential. Quadratic is around 5,000 wherereas exponential is around 10,000
	    for 40, They become more scattered and th Stay below 5,000 except for Log linear, quadratic and cubic and exponential. See attached image for table
